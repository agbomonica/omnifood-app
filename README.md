# Omnifood Website

Omnifood is a premium food subscription plan that offers healthy and nutritional meals customized to user's needs.

## Core Technologies:

- HTML for MarkUp
- Vanilla CSS for visual styles & representation
- Javascript to implement a Sticky header (using Intersection Observer), animated smooth scrolling and the navigation toggle.

## Performance Behaviour & page Responsiveness

Omnifood was built with responsive design and good performance behaviour in mind:

- For responsive design: Modern properties of CSS3 i.e CSS grid and flexbox fluid layouts, responsive units, flexible images and media queries were utilized.

- By adopting the 2x Scale factor to account for screen size(s) with high resolution and also optimizing images through image compression, performance index was great. Google lighthouse was used for this test.

- By adopting a set of design best practices, Omnifood is SEO friendly and accessible to screen readers.
